This application is built using Next.js, a powerful React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.

We have integrated Clerk for seamless user authentication, providing a secure and user-friendly login experience.

Our backend is powered by MongoDB, a NoSQL database, and we use Mongoose for elegant MongoDB object modeling in Node.js.

This project serves as a comprehensive template for building full-stack web applications with authentication. Feel free to customize it to suit your needs!
